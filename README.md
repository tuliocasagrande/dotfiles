# dotfiles
This is a collection of my personal dotfiles.

## Installation
Clone the project in your home directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/tuliocasagrande/dotfiles.git
```

You can either create symbolic links for each file you want, e.g.:
```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/
```

Or copy the files in case you don't want to keep track of any changes, e.g.:
```
cp ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/
```

There's also an installation script that you can use:
```
./install.sh
```
