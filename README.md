# dotfiles
This is a collection of my personal dotfiles.

## Installation
Clone the project in your home directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/tuliocasagrande/dotfiles.git
```

Create symbolic links for each file, e.g.:
```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/
```

Alternatively, you can copy the files in case you don't want to keep track of any changes, e.g.:
```
cp ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/
```
